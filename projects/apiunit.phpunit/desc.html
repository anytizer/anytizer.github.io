<p>The REST API testing is now made very easy, using <a href="https://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a> and my <a href="#">relay</a> class based on <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php">curl</a>.</p>
<p>Technical Support is available to donors. Educates on how to install, embed and use it in your projects.</p>
<p>The nicest part of the project is that it can "host" unit tests for your own projects, that are not the part of this project directly. Consider adding a soft link to your API Unit Tests inside this project. For windows, use <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc753194(v=ws.11).aspx">mklink</a>, for linux use <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ln.1.html">ln</a>.</p>
