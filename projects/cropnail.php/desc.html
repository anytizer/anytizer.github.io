<p>Generate better thumbnails of any dimensions, without losing the original aspect ratio.</p>

<h2>As CLI Tool</h2>
<p>Cropnail also has a command line interface to organize your photos. It features to group the photos by their dimensions, resize images and create thumbnails - all in command line.</p>

<h3>Usage examples</h3>
<code>
	<p>cropnail list</p>
	<p>cropnail group</p>
	<p>cropnail 200x450 source.png target.png</p>
	<p>cropnail 400x200 source.png target.png</p>
</code>
